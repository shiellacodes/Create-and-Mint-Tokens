# Create-and-Mint-Tokens
Types of Function - ETH + AVAX

## Description
This program is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is built with a constructor, two file imports, and three functions that shows how the program mint, burn, or transfer tokens. This program serves as an introduction to learn the basic understanding about Creating and Minting Tokens

## Getting Started
### Installing
### Executing Program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file: [https://github.com/shiellacodes/Metacrafters_Project_CreateAndMintToken/blob/main/CreateAndMintToken.sol](https://github.com/shiellacodes/Create-and-Mint-Tokens.git)

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.9" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Enter a name, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

By clicking the drop down option beside **mint**, it will create new tokens and assigns them to a specified address.
By clicking the drop down option beside **burn**, it will allow a token holder to destroy a specified amount of their tokens, reducing the total supply.
By clicking the drop down option beside **transfer**, it will transfer tokens from the callerâ€™s address to another address.
By clicking the drop down option beside **balanceOf**, it will return the token balance of a specific address.
By clicking the drop down option beside **totalSupply**, it will return the total supply of the tokens in circulation.
By clicking the drop down option beside **name**, it will return the name of the token.
By clicking the drop down option beside **symbol**, it will return the symbol of the token (used for trading).
By clicking the drop down option beside **owner**, it will return the address of the contract owner.
By clicking the drop down option beside **transferFrom**, it will allow an approved address to transfer tokens on behalf of another address.
